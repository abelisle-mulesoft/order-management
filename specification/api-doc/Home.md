# Welcome to the API Portal of the Order Management Microservice

As its name implies, this microservice manages orders for Brilliant Mule's e-commerce website. We designed and implemented it using a top-down or contract-first approach and authored its API specification using the Open API Specification (OAS) version 3.0. Finally, we leverage Anypoint Flex Gateway to manage and secure access to the Order Management microservice.  

In the current version, the Order Management microservice supports the following methods:

1. Create a new order.
2. Retrieve all orders.
3. Retrieve a order by its ID.
4. Update a order.
5. Delete a order.

Refer to the ***Summary*** section for further details on these methods and their expected behavior.
